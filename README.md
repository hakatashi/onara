onara
=====

Comprehensive onara collectioin for every programmer.

# What is onara?

onara is a Japanese word that means 'fart'.

# How come this project started?

The first mind of 'onara' was derived from the idea that an Japanese ASCII art `orz=3`
that represents 'onara' could be
interpreted as assignment function of popular programing language. And obviously here comes an innovation.
Yay!
