Comprehensive onara collectioin for every programmer.

# What is onara?

onara is a Japanese word that means 'fart'.

# How come this project started?

The first mind of 'onara' was derived from the idea that a Japanese ASCII art `orz=3`
that represents 'onara' can be interpreted as assignment function of popular programing language.
And what should I do was totally settled.
Yay!
